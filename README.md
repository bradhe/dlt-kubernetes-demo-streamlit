> DLT + Motherduck + Streamlit

See a [live demo!](https://2y3ykryzwr8navpwlfiuyd.streamlit.app/)

You can check out the pipeline side of this project at
[bradhe/dlt-kubernetes-demo](https://github.com/bradhe/dlt-kubernetes-demo). This is in a separate repo to facilitate
Streamlit Community integration.

## Development

To start the app locally, you need to export your MotherDuck token.

```bash
$ export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN = "<your MotherDuck JWT>"
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
